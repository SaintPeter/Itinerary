Itinerary: Time scheduling toolset for .NET
Shawn Poulson, http://explodingcoder.com

* What does Itinerary do?
  - Describe an abstract schedule of timed events as an expression, such as the equivalent of:
    "Every Friday at 5:30 pm for 1 hour, except on holidays."
  - Perform complex boolean set math on timed events.
  - Parse expressions to enumerate timed events in the schedule.
  - Change schedule properties programmatically, then reserialize back to expression.

* What doesn't Itinerary do?
  - Does not actively run things on a schedule.  That's your job.
  - Does not perform timezone computation.  All date/times are timezone agnostic.

* Why use Itinerary?
  - You need to describe complex recurrance patterns and/or arbitrary schedules of date/times.
  - You need to store this description (not the events) for later reuse.

* How do I get started using Itinrary?
  - Learn TDL expression syntax from the Itinerary Wiki on GitHub:
    https://github.com/spoulson/Itinerary/wiki
  - Test TDL expression syntax using the TDL Explorer tool in the solution.
  - See the example projects and unit tests for reference.
